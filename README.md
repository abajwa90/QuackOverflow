Welcome to the Virtual Rubber Duck Chat, your virtual companion for debugging and problem-solving! This interactive chat application is designed to mimic the experience of explaining your code conundrums to a rubber duck.

## Features:
- **Rubber Duck Interface:** Engage in a conversation with a virtual rubber duck, just like you would in real life.
- **HTML/CSS/JS Implementation:** Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## How to Use:
1. **Explain Your Problem:** Type out your coding issue or bug in the chat window.
2. **Talk it Through:** Engage in a dialogue with the virtual rubber duck by typing your thoughts and describing your code.

## How It Works:
- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the chat interface.
- **CSS:** Styles the chat interface to resemble a conversation with a rubber duck.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the interactivity of the chat, allowing for dynamic conversation between the user and the duck.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5:** Used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3:** Utilized for styling and visual enhancements.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implemented for interactive features and user engagement.

## Getting Started:
To run the Virtual Rubber Duck Chat locally, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
